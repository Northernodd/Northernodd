Hello, I am Northernodd or Tyler (he/him/his)! I am currently studying Cyber Security at a local college. To pair up with that I decided to work on a diploma on for computer languages which includes C++, HTML/CSS, C#, Python, and Java.

As of now I'm working on the HTML/CSS and C++ parts of the diploma in particular :0 

Currently I am not looking to collaborate on any projects
